Description: The BACprior package provides an approximate sensitivity analysis of the 
 Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding (BAC) algorithm (Wang et al., 2012) with regards to the
 hyperparameter omega. The package also provides functions to guide the user in their choice
 of an appropriate omega value. The method is based on Lefebvre, Atherton and Talbot (2014).
