01/22/2013 :
- Corrected a bug in BACprior.lm which caused the full model not to be considered. 
  This bug did not return an error message, but results were wrong.
- Corrected a bug in BACprior.lm which occured when only one model received
  all posterior weight. This bug returned an error message and the function did not return
  any results when it occured.
- The results of BACprior.lm incorrectly titled a column as standard deviation (was variance).
  Results now really return posterior standard deviation.
